# Common standard keys:
# control-a Move to the start of the line.
# control-e Move to the end of the line.
# control-l Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

# Alt/Option/Meta + arrow left/right for word skip
#"\e\e[C": forward-word
#"\e\e[D": backward-word
